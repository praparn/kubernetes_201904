# Rule

_**NOTE:** The rule component is experimental since it has conceptual tradeoffs that might not be favorable for most use cases. It is recommended to keep deploying rules to the relevant Prometheus servers._

_The rule component should in particular not be used to circumvent solving rule deployment properly at the configuration management level._

The rule component evaluates Prometheus recording and alerting rules against random query nodes in its cluster. Rule results are written back to disk in the Prometheus 2.0 storage format. Rule nodes at the same time participate in the cluster themselves as source store nodes and upload their generated TSDB blocks to an object store.

The data of each rule node can be labeled to satisfy the clusters labeling scheme. High-availability pairs can be run in parallel and should be distinguished by the designated replica label, just like regular Prometheus servers.

```
$ thanos rule \
    --data-dir          "/path/to/data" \
    --eval-interval     "30s" \
    --rule-file         "/path/to/rules/*.rules.yaml" \
    --alert.query-url   "http://0.0.0.0:9090" \
    --alertmanagers.url "alert.thanos.io" \
    --cluster.peers     "thanos-cluster.example.org" \
    --objstore.config-file "bucket.yml"
```

The content of `bucket.yml`:

```yaml
type: GCS
config:
  bucket: example-bucket
```

As rule nodes outsource query processing to query nodes, they should generally experience little load. If necessary, functional sharding can be applied by splitting up the sets of rules between HA pairs.
Rules are processed with deduplicated data according to the replica label configured on query nodes.

                                 'dns+' or 'dnssrv+' to detect Alertmanager IPs
                                 through respective DNS lookups. The port
                                 defaults to 9093 or the SRV record's value. The
                                 URL path is used as a prefix for the regular

                                 alertmanager. This allows alert to be
                                 deduplicated on replica label (repeated).

                                 query API servers through respective DNS
                                 lookups.
